## Energy Consumption Dashboard (Power BI)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of electricity, gas, and water consumption across multiple buildings. The dashboard helps organizations monitor energy usage trends, track costs, and compare consumption across locations over time.

## Project Overview

The Energy Consumption Dashboard is built in **Power BI** and provides:

- Total energy cost and total units consumed
- Consumption trends over time
- Cost analysis by building
- Filtering by city, building, and date range
- Visual breakdown of electricity, gas, and water usage

The dashboard is designed to help facility managers, analysts, and decision-makers reduce waste and identify energy efficiency opportunities.
